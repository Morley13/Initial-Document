\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

For my project I will be designing and implementing the board game of Hnefatafl - a Viking game in Java. Board games have been around for as long as humans 	have had the capability of imagination\cite{johnston2015past} and Hnefatafl is no different. There are many variations and adaptations of the game.\\Hnefatafl is played between two players, an attacker and a defender, the objective of the game is for the attacker to capture the defenders king and for the defender to get the king to the edge of the board; however, in every adaptation of the game, the attackers outnumber the defenders. consequently, Hnefatafl is a game of pure strategy which takes a great deal of skill to master.
